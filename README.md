#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the art or discipline under computer science that deals with the design, implementation, testing and the maintenance of software applications.
It is fundamental in the technology landscape due to the following reasons.
It ensures information technology systems are efficient thus can manage vast amounts of datasets.
Software engineering solutions enable automation of tasks such as security monitoring, backing up data and processing of data.
It enables customization of It solutions to meet specific needs of organizations.
Creation of cost-effective solutions through its development methodology.
Software engineering enables innovative solutions to be ideated.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s)
The Agile Manifesto and Agile Development (2001)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
There six phases of the SDLC which are:
Planning: it is where the specifics of the projects are layed out. Business requirements form stakeholders or clients are gathered and evaluated. This phase is when you revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, for instance.
Design: In this phase, the software design is created, which includes the overall architecture of the software, data structures, and interfaces.
Implementation: The design is then implemented in code, usually in several iterations.
Testing: The software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works correctly.
Deployment: After successful testing, The software is deployed to a production environment and made available to end-users.
Maintenance: This phase includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear form of software development in which each phase of the SDLC has to be completed before transitioning to the next phase of development. The end goal of each phase has a clear set of objectives and requirements to be met. An example of waterfall methodology in use is at a construction project where deliverables have been clearly set by the client. 
Agile methodology on the other hand is iterative in nature with the development moving back and forth between the different phases of development. Users are involved in each phase of the SDLC and their feedback is used to improve the end product. An example of agile in use is a complex software project that requires different development teams such as UX designers, front end developers and back end developers.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are incharge of coding and implementing product requirements.  They write codes, collaborate with other tech specialists to realize the solutions, review and document the codes.
Quality assurance engineers are  incharge of making sure software meets a certain standard or quality. They organize tests for software, review the tests and collaborate with developers to make improvements on software.
Project managers are responsible for managing and coordinating team members who are also communicating with project sponsors or clients. They define project scope, develop  timelines, work breakdown structure and perform risk analysis.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are crucial in software development as they provide the development environment for writing, editing, reviewing and running codes. Examples are Visual Studio code and Pycharm.
VCS are crucial in monitoring code changes, managing code and managing the history of code over time. Example is  Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Short deadlines: Meeting project deadlines is a daunting task especially with projects that receive new information or with unclear scope. These could lead to burnout as developers struggle to meet the project deadline. This can be tackled through proper communication between developers, breaking the project into small manageable tasks and using project management tools such as asana.
Ever advancing technology tools: Technology and software development tools are ever evolving with new languages, and frameworks being invented. Thus, for developers to remain relevant and up to date they have to keep on upskilling by practicing on developing using new languages, attending conferences and so on.
Scope creep: It comes from poorly designed project scopes that are unclear. To tackle this developers must ensure proper requirements gathering was performed and utilize methodologies such as Agile and scrum to iteratively define the scope.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: It is a testing technique wherein the simple or smallest units of a software program are examined personally for bugs and errors. It is important in quality assurance as it can be run every time a piece of code is changed, allowing issues to be resolved as quickly as possible.
Integration testing: It gives developers the opportunity to combine all of the units within a program and test them as a group. This testing level is designed to find interface defects between the modules or function. It is crucial as it enables issues related to data flow, communication, and compatibility between modules to be caught earlier on. 
System testing is the first level in which the complete application is tested as a whole. The goal at this level is to evaluate whether the system has complied with all of the outlined requirements and to see that it meets Quality Standards. It is important as it verifies whether the application meets the technical, functional, and business requirements that were set by the customer.
Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether the system is ready for release. It is the final level of testing. It is crucial as it serves to validate whether the system is ready for use in the real world.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions, queries or prompt to AI models in order to get the most suitable outcome. It is important as it enables AI to get input that is clear and precise and in return generates  better outputs and many more

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt “What is climate change”
Improved prompt “Describe the impact of climate change on ocean ecosystems, including effects on marine species and coral reefs.”
In the first prompt the query is general and could lead to the AI model producing output that covers multiple topics. The AI will only focus on giving the definition and some examples. However in the second prompt it is more detailed and focused as such the model will provide enough detail on climate change and thoroughly cover AI in on the ocean ecosystem and how it adversely impacts marine life species and the coral reefs.
